# sketch-log
This is a collection of sketches made with JavaScript and the p5.js library,
somewhat of a documentation of my own progress as I learn to use different creative coding
tools for generative design, as well a place to share what I'm up to.

These works are more of an exploration and part of a process than anything else,
but do feel free to contact me in case you want to know more.
